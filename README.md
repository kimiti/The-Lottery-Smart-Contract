## The Lottery - Planning and Design

### Lottery algorithm:

- [] The lottery starts accepting transactions, anyone having an etherium wallet can send a minimum amount of 0.01 Ether

- The players send Ether directly to the constract address and after that their etherium address is registered.

- There will be a manager the account that deploys the contract

- at some point randomly chosen by the manger the manager will pick a winner at rnadom from the players list

- only the manger is allowed to see the constract balance

- the constract will transfer entire balance to the winner address

- and the lottery is reset and reday to go for the next round
